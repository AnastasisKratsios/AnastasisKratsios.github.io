# *Geometric Deep Learning for Quantitative Finance*


## Perspective
I develop efficient geometric deep learning architectures and meta-procedures that leverage non-Euclidean structure permeating the contemporary financial landscape.


## Topics of Interest

My research focuses on geometric deep learning methods, foundations of learning theory such as universal approximation, and implications in architecture construction and applications of those tools to mathematical finance problems.  As a mathematician, under the hood of each of my research papers, you'll find a medley of geometric topology, non-linear functional analysis, Î“-convergence methods, and stochastic analysis.  As a scientist, every research project addresses a pointed practical problem.
